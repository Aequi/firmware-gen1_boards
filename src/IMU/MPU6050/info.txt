32-bit ARM STM32F103xx family of microcontrollers. It has been tested on Olimex STM32-P103 development board. This library depends on only two header files from STM32F10xFWLib v3.3.0:

stm32f10x.h
stm32f10x_i2c.h

Here is few lines of code showing how to use this library:

#include "MPU6050.h"
MPU6050_I2C_Init();
MPU6050_Initialize();
if( MPU6050_TestConnection()== TRUE);
{
   // connection success
}else
{
   // connection failed
}

int16_t  AccelGyro[6]={0};
MPU6050_GetRawAccelGyro(AccelGyro);
